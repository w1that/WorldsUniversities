# WorldsUniversities
 I believe the best way to practice is to develop small apps. I made this app to learn how to perform asynchronous api requests while using redux with @reduxjs/toolkit. According to the country you choose, it lists the universities that exist in that country. Since it is a minimalist application, I used a few bootstrap components. Used no-authorization-apis: "http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?country=", "https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all"
